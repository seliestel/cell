The Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) is a trans-national area bound together by the Mekong River, covering 2.6 million square kilometers and a combined population of around 326 million. It comprises Cambodia, Yunnan and Guangxi Zhuang in the People's Republic of China, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam. 

The edited collection *Human Rights and Sustainability in the Greater Mekong* aims to provide the first interdisciplinary survey of the state of human rights, environmental justice and sustainable development in the region. It is edited by a group of scholars working at the HUSUME research group of Mae Fah Luang University in Thailand. The editors hope that the volume will reach wide global audiences and draw attention to the key outstanding problems and challenges affecting human rights and sustainability in this rapidly transforming region.

Prospective contributors are invited to submit proposals on topics including, but not limited to, the following:

* Women equality and empowerment
* Sexual orientation and gender identity issues
* Political plurality and democracy
* Grassroots activism and contestation
* Deforestation, climate change and ecological justice
* Rule of law
* Border issues, refugees, migrants and stateless individuals
* Animal rights
* Freedom of speech and plurality of media
* National and transnational human rights institutions
* NGOs and international cooperation
* Human trafficking and exploitation
* Sustainable development
* Food security
* Health and social security

* Children’s rights and education
* War and crimes against humanity
* Freedom of religion
* Criminal justice system and legal guarantees
* Political corruption and abuse of power
* Domestic and sexual violence
* Ethnic conflicts and minorities
* Terrorism and counterterrorism

Proposals can combine or modify these and other related topics. But please bear in mind that chapters should provide comprehensive coverage of the state of the topic chosen across the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS). Specific case studies may be included in the chapter, but the aim of the collection is to provide a thorough review of the most important outstanding areas related with human rights and sustainability throughout the region. Examples and case studies should be used to illustrate general points and to enlighten an in-depth exposition of each topic. Submitted chapters will be peer-reviewed and selected based on their ability to provide a concise and up-to-date presentation that can serve as reference for scholars, activists, decision makers and readers interested in the topics covered.
