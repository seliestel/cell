# Research

The HUSUME research group promotes and develops knowledge about human rights, democracy and sustainability. We believe these themes to be closely linked and to require an effective interdisciplinary research effort that can only be achieved by bringing together scholars from various disciplines to work on common projects and to share knowledge and ideas.

The geographical focus of our research is the [Greater Mekong Subregion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Mekong_Subregion) (GMS), a trans-national area in Southeast Asia bound together by the Mekong River, covering 2.6 million square kilometers and a combined population of around 326 million. The GMS comprises Cambodia, Yunnan and Guangxi Zhuang in the People’s Republic of China, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam.

The HUSUME research group explores the legal, economic, social, cultural and environmental dimensions of human rights and sustainability in the GMS using a multi-disciplinary approach that draws from multiple fields in the social sciences, law and humanities:

- Political science
- Political ecology
- Sociology
- Human rights law
- Environmental law
- Sustainable development
- Conflict and peace studies
- Animal studies
- Cultural studies
- Environmental humanities
- Cultural anthropology
- Critical theory

Human rights are the basic rights and freedoms to which every human is entitled, including the right to life and liberty, freedom of thought and expression, and equality before the law, amongst others. In the GMS, as in many other areas of the world, these basic human rights are far from being effectively protected and safeguarded. Our group is committed to support research that helps to promote these and other human rights throughout the region. 

In line with the [UN Human Rights Council](https://www.ohchr.org/en/Issues/RuleOfLaw/Pages/Democracy.aspx), we believe that there is an “interdependent and mutually reinforcing relationship between democracy and human rights.” Our group aims to support research that strengthens rule of law, free elections and other essential instruments of good governance and public accountability, while also promoting grassroots democratic participation and empowerment at all levels of society.

As an interdisciplinary group of scholars, we recognize that human rights are not just a matter of law and governance but are closely linked with social, economic, cultural and environmental factors. These factors directly affect the capacity of human individuals and communities to adapt to their environments and develop sustainably in the long term. Our group supports research that takes all of these factors into account in order to provide a comprehensive and in-depth understanding of sustainability in the region.

Poverty, marginalization and inequalities within and across states are serious human rights concerns, and HUSUME aims to support research on marginalized and vulnerable groups (ethnic and religious minorities, women, children, etc.), as well as on the policy and institutional frameworks that have an impact on the social, economic, cultural and environmental rights of these groups.

Moreover, we believe that human rights and sustainable development cannot be achieved if we continue to separate humans from nonhumans and from their natural environment. Our group aims to support research based on a biocentric perspective, which effectively brings the concerns of the wider biotic community and shared ecosystems into the analysis of human rights and sustainability.

Based at [Mae Fah Luang University](https://en.mfu.ac.th/home.html) (Chiang Rai, Thailand), the HUSUME research group's mission is to:

- provide a forum for members to discuss ongoing research and develop new research ideas and projects;
- help members submit research grant applications;
- submit research and other scholarly work for publication, both individually and collectively;
- participate in international conferences and seminars; 
- organize workshops, seminars, conferences, meetings and presentations by group members and visiting scholars; 
- facilitate collaboration with other researchers and academic institutions worldwide;
- facilitate collaboration with officials, activists and other actors working on human rights and sustainability in the region.
